        = MAIN CLI FOR GENERATING METRICS ON VARIOUS DNN CONFIGURATIONS. OPTIONS INCLUDE NUMBER OF HIDDEN LAYERS/NODES, CONVERGENCE ITERATION CAP, AND TRAINING/VALIDATION RATIO. OUTPUTS GRAPHICS TO GAUGE PERFORMANCE WITH ABILITY TO DUMP DATA AFTER ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE. BASED ON MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON REGRESSION.
    - make_data.py
        = UTILITY SCRIPT TO BUILD DATASETS FOR PERFORMANCE TESTING.

> USAGE/EXAMPLES:
    - python3 ./make_data.py
        = MAKE TEST DATASET. CONFIGURATION CARRIED OUT WITHIN SOURCE FILE.
    - python3 ./mlmetrics.py 100 -f 0.75 -vv
        = SELECTS THE FIRST 100 SAMPLES FROM DEFAULT DATA FILE AND TRAINS WITH 75 SAMPLES, LEAVING 25 FOR VALIDATION AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS. VERBOSITY LEVEL 2.
    - python3 ./mlmetrics.py 1000 -i 5000,10000 -l 5:5,3:5,7 -s 10
        = SELECTS FIRST 1000 SAMPLES FROM DEFAULT DATA FILE AND RUNS A TOTAL OF 6 DIFFERENT CONFIGURATIONS OF REGRESSOR, EACH WITH 10 EQUIDISTANT STEPS BETWEEN 0 AND (SAMPLE_DATA_SIZE * SAMPLE_TRAINING_FACTOR). PERMUTATIONS OF ITERATIONS AND HIDDEN LAYER/NODE CONFIGURATIONS ARE DISPLAYED IN SEPARATE GRAPHS. THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS CONVERGENCE LIMITS OF 5000 AND 10000 ITERATIONS, ALONG WITH HIDDEN LAYER NODE CONFIGURATIONS OF: SINGLE HIDDEN LAYER WITH 5 NODES; 2 HIDDEN LAYERS WITH 5 AND 3 NODES; 2 HIDDEN LAYERS WITH 5 AND 7 NODES. LAYER CONFIGURATIONS ARE DESCRIBED FROM INPUT NODES TOWARDS OUTPUT NODES.
    - python3 ./mlmetrics.py 100 -d './sin.data'
        = SELECTS THE FIRST 100 SAMPLES FROM INPUT DATA FILE AND RUNS DEFAULT ANALYSIS.
    - python3 ./mlmetrics.py -h
        = GET HELP.
